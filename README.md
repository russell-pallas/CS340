How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  Maintainable, readable and adaptable code revolves around two concepts, cleanliness and commenting. Good code is concise and workable. Good code also relies upon comments to ensure that someone who hasn't worked on the code can look at it and understand what is happening with the code. In the CRUD module, we ensured that code was as simple as possible while also ensuring that it was thorough enough to accomplish the goal. The modularity of the code means that we could change some parts of the code and use it in a similar project in the future. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.
  I personally approach problems with a trial and error mindset. I personally like to use dynamic testing of code. This means that I will write certain sections of code, test it, and change what needs to be changed. 

How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  My approach to this project differened in the sense that I needed to think about user interface. This meant that I needed to do what a customer would like rather than something that just works. In the future, I would like to include automated testing. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists help to connect people to things that they use everyday, technology. This is important because the world would come to a grinding halt without it. Some might think that once code is written and deployed, computer scientists are no longer needed. This, however, is assuming that nobody wants updates and bug fizes to their programs. Markets are constantly changing. For that reason, companies will always need computer scientists to help keep their platforms up to date wtih their ever changing customer base.
